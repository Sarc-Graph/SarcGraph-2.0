**SarcGraph** is a tool for automatic detection, tracking and analysis of
z-discs and sarcomeres in movies of beating *human induced pluripotent stem
cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs)*.

Overview
--------

**SarcGraph** was initially introduced in
`"Sarc-Graph: Automated segmentation, tracking, and analysis of sarcomeres in
hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes" <https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009443>`_.
This package is created to make **SarcGraph** more accessible to the broader
research community.

Key Features
------------

**SarcGraph** includes functions to detect and track z-discs and sarcomeres in
beating cells, construct spatial graphs of z-discs and sarcomeres for network
distance computation, and perform automated spatiotemporal analysis and data
visualization.
